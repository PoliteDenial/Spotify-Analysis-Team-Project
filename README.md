# Spotify Data Science
## Credits
- This project was done by myself and Avery Fulton our other group member did not write a single line of code (as shown in the commit history). 
- While he did write a extremely poor verison of the paper that also was heavily edited to better reflect the project. 

## Background
- The overall goal of this analysis is to determine statistically significant correlations between a particular song metrics or “Audio Features” and predict a songs chart ranking based on those "Audio Features".

## The project will atttempt to answer the following:
  - What metrics can be used to measure the likelihood of a song “trending”? 
  - Typically what songs trend in a particular region? 
  - How can we predict the kind of songs that will be popular in the future
  - Can machine learning models and regression models be applied to accurately predict a songs chart ranking in a region?

## Presenation Slides:
![](./ppt_pres/pres_slow.gif)

- Please note that under the **/ppt_pres/** folder the slides can be downloaded in 3 formats, with the PDF being the highest quality.
- The final paper is depth verison of the anaylsis with a bit more detail on methods if your curious about it give it a read.

Thanks for looking at the Project, Best Zain
